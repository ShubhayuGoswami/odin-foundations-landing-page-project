This was rather fun to work on.

Took me around 7 days to complete but majority on the work was done in like the last 2 to 3 days.

I used css flex where it was needed and at some places kept it display:inline; for making it convinient to work on that particular section.

Need to look into the commit messages lesson again because I got very lazy on the commit messages. But again, I kept making changes on the fly to the html file according to convinience and needs of the css, so it was kinda hard for me to remember all the changes that I made, but again, should have done atomic commits instead for commiting only 1 section at a time.

Will look to avoid all the shortcomings in the coming projects.
